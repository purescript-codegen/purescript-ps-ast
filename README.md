# purescript-ps-past

If you are looking for fully fledged PS AST for your codegen solution please check the purescript-ps-cst library.

This project provides simple, incomplete PS AST (it covers a subset of the language) which was used for quick prototyping and codegen from typescript in the case of purescript-react-basic-mui library. We keep it currently here for the reference and maybe for some further experimentation too. It is possible that we we drop it entirely in the future.
